**Character Preset Framework (CPF)** is a framework for *Baldur's Gate 3* that enables players to save, share, and apply complete character appearance presets. Users can access CPF via the in-game interface (default keybind: `SHIFT+P` configurable through MCM) to capture their character's appearance and apply presets from other players or mods.

Mod authors can create and distribute character preset mods, providing players with ready-to-use character appearances. The framework handles all the complexity of character appearance data, including automatic dependency detection for modded assets, compatibility validation, and seamless integration with the game's character creation system.

## Features

- **Complete appearance capture**: Save all aspects of character appearance including visuals, colors, body type, race, and modded assets.
- **Preset sharing**: Export presets as JSON files to share with other players or import community-created presets.
- **Automatic dependency detection**: Automatically identifies and tracks all mods used in a preset, warning users about missing dependencies.
- **Compatibility validation**: Validates preset compatibility with the target character (race, body type, body shape) before application.
- **Real-time preview**: View preset details, author information, version, and required mods before applying.
- **MCM integration**: Seamless integration with Mod Configuration Menu for easy access and keybinding management.
- **Mirror (appearance change) full support**: Save and apply presets during magic mirror usage.
- **Character creation partial support**: Save presets during character creation.
- **Preset management**: Hide/unhide presets, reset preset index, and organize your preset library.
- **Localization support**: Displays strings in the user's preferred language if translations are provided.
